    <div class="feature"><p><strong>Friends is an American television sitcom, created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, which aired on NBC from September 22, 1994, 
        to May 6, 2004, lasting ten seasons. The show revolves around six friends in their 20s and 30s who live in Manhattan, New York City. 
        The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions, in association with Warner Bros. Television. The original executive producers were 
        Kevin S. Bright, Kauffman, and Crane.</p></strong></div>

    <div class="listing"><p>Series creator David Crane wanted all six actors to be equally prominent, and the series was lauded as being "the first true 
        'ensemble' show. The cast members made efforts to keep the ensemble format and not allow one member to dominate; they entered themselves 
        in the same acting categories for awards, opted for collective salary negotiations, and asked to appear together on magazine cover 
        photos in the first season. The cast members also became best friends off-screen, so much so that recurring guest star Tom Selleck 
        reported that he sometimes felt left out.
        <br><br>
        The cast remained good friends after the series run, most notably Cox and Aniston, with Aniston being godmother to Cox and David 
        Arquette's daughter, Coco. In the official farewell commemorative book Friends 'Til the End, each separately acknowledged in interviews 
        that the cast had become their family.</p></div>
